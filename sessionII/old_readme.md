## Session II: Introduction to Unix / O2 and NGS Data Analysis

### Description

Session II will start with a discussion of the RNA-seq workflow, highlighting different quantification strategies. We will then tackle additional quality control assessment of STAR-aligned data using the Qualimap tool in order to identify any issues related to contamination or biases in our data. Then, we will use Salmon to perform a more accurate quasi-alignment and quantification. We will finish the session by introducing R, which we need to start with differential expression analysis of our count data.

**Day1:** We will start the first day learning about various types of tools for alignment and quantification. Then we will align the raw sequence data using STAR followed by quality assessment with Qualimap. Students will determine whether the data has any worrisome contamination or biases before moving on to quasi-alignment and quantification with Salmon. MultiQC will be used to assess the quality of the data at all steps in the analysis and is also useful for detecting bias and contamination issues present in the data. We will end the day with an introduction to R and RStudio.

**Day2:** During the second day of this session, we will dive into R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Within R, we will explore basic data structures, data types, data inspection and extraction, reading and writing files, data wrangling, visualization methods using ggplot2 package.
