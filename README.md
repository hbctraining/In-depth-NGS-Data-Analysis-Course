# In-depth NGS Data Analysis Course

| Audience | Computational Skills | Prerequisites | Duration |
:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Biologists | Beginner/Intermediate | None | 12-day workshop (~78 hours of trainer-led time)|

This repository contains all course materials for the Fall 2018 version of HBC's In-depth NGS Data Analysis Course, a 12-day course run over 6 weeks.

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but they are also amenable to self-guided learning.

The course is aimed at bench biologists who are interested in learning about NGS-based genomic analysis. The topics covered in-depth during this course are analysis of RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data, with an optional Variant Calling session. The sessions will also include functional analysis downstream of sequence data processing. During this course, participants will gain skills in the areas of:
 
* UNIX and basic shell scripting
* high-performance compute clusters, and 
* R for statistical analysis and data visualization. 

At the end of this course, participants can expect to have the expertise to independently run data analysis for sequencing experiments.

**No prior programming experience or command-line training is required.**

This repo contains the materials for the six sessions of the course.
